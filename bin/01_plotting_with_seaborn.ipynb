    "In the previous notebook, we showed a simple example of plotting using `matplotlib` to demonstrate figuring embedding using magic commands. In this notebook, we will demonstrate plotting using [`seaborn`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), a Python data visualization library based on `matplotlib`. This package allows for the creation of attractive and informative graphics. First, lets import the `seaborn` library!"
